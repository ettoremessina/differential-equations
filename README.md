# Differential Equations
The goal of this repository is to share a suite of demos and examples written in Python to deal with differential equations.

## ODEs
[ODEs](./ODEs) folder contains demos and examples to deal with ordinary differential equations and their systems.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/neural-networks/ordinary-differential-equation-solvers.html) for demos of ODE solvers in Python.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/mathematics/experiments-with-sympy-to-solve-odes-1st-order.html) for demos of SymPy to solve analytically ODEs in Python. 

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/neural-networks/experiments-with-neural-odes-in-julia.html) for demos of ODE solvers in Julia.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/neural-networks/experiments-with-neural-odes-in-python-with-tensorflowdiffeq.html) for Neural ODEs experiments with TensorFlowDiffEq.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/mathematics/analyzer-of-a-constant-coefficient-linear-and-homogeneous-dynamical-system-on-plane.html) for a tool written in Python to study the behavior of a linear and homogeneous dynamic system on the plane with constant coefficients defined by a system of two differential equations expressed in matrix form.

## DDEs

[DDEs](./DDEs) folder contains demos and examples to deal with delay differential equations.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/mathematics/method-solving-first-order-dde-using-lambert-w-function.html) to see a method to solve first-order DDEs using Lambert W function
