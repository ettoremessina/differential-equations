# Differential Equations
The goal of this repository is to share a suite of demos and examples written in Python to deal with differential equations.

## ODEs
[ODEs](./ODEs) folder contains demos and examples to deal with ordinary differential equations and their systems.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/neural-networks/ordinary-differential-equation-solvers.html) for demos of ODE solvers in Python.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/neural-networks/experiments-with-neural-odes-in-julia.html) for demos of ODE solvers in Julia.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/neural-networks/experiments-with-neural-odes-in-python-with-tensorflowdiffeq.html) for Neural ODEs experiments with TensorFlowDiffEq.
